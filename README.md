This repository implements a framework for discovering the intrinsic geometry of financial time series through variational autoencoders. By treating the VAE decoder as a parameterization of an embedded manifold, we compute Riemannian metric tensors and geodesic distances that respect the learned curvature of market states.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv geometry
source geometry/bin/activate  # On Windows: geometry\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Complete Pipeline

```bash
cd src/

# Step 1: Train the β-VAE with specialized loss
python train_vae.py

# Step 2: Evaluate latent space quality 
python evaluate_vae.py ../results/vae_training_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

# Step 3: Analyze manifold geometry and clustering
python analyze_latent_geometry.py ../results/vae_training_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Train β-VAE (`train_vae.py`)
Train a β-Variational Autoencoder with specialized loss components for financial time series stability:
- Posterior collapse prevention through KL capacity scheduling
- Orthogonality regularization for disentangled latent factors
- Robust training pipeline for financial data

### 2. Evaluate Model (`evaluate_vae.py`) 
Validate latent space quality and training convergence:
- Latent space orthogonality analysis
- Distribution normality checks
- Training curve diagnostics

### 3. Analyze Geometry (`analyze_latent_geometry.py`)
Compute manifold geometry and perform curvature-aware clustering:
- Riemannian metric tensor computation via decoder Jacobians
- Geodesic distance calculation
- Clustering comparison (Euclidean vs Geodesic vs PCA)
- 3D visualizations of learned manifold structure

## Paper Reference

This implementation supports the research described in:

**"Market Manifolds: β-VAE Learning and Geometry on Time Series"**

*Abstract*: Financial markets exhibit complex, non-linear dynamics that traditional Euclidean models often fail to capture. This paper introduces a novel framework for learning and analyzing the underlying geometry of financial market states using β-VAEs with Riemannian metric computation.

## Future Research Directions

- **Generative Modeling**: Sample realistic market scenarios along geodesic paths
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agents directly on the learned manifold  
- **Risk Management**: Use curvature as an early warning signal for instability
- **Multi-Asset**: Extend framework to FX, commodities, and crypto markets
